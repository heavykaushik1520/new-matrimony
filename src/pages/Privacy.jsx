            servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a token is found to be compromised or misused, access may be
            restricted to protect your account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="font-medium mt-3">Token Expiry</h4>

          For security purposes, all JWT tokens include a predefined expiration
          time. Once the token expires, you will be required to log in again to
          continue using protected services.
